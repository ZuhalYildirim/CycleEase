# CycleEase
Under this project, Ajay Ajay, Peter Meiers, Zühal Yıldırım, and Ahmad Abubakar collaborated to produce zones related to biking in Münster as part of the "Cycling for Everyone: Interactive Workshop Series for Barrier-Free Cycling in Münster" initiative. 

The main goal of this project was to create a map of Münster that highlights the calmness, easiness, and safety zones for cyclists. While the map can be used by anyone, the primary focus is to identify optimal cycling locations for people with neurological conditions, ensuring they could safely and comfortably engage in cycling activities within the city. Each team member contributed their expertise to various aspects of the project, from data collection and analysis to design and planning, ultimately working towards creating a more inclusive cycling environment in Münster.

- Calm zones (areas with low noise, traffic, and crowds)
- Safe cycling routes (areas with physical separation from traffic and fewer junctions)
- Easy-to-navigate areas (smooth surfaces and fewer intersections)
